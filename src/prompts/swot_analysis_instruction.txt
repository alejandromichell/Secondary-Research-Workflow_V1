### SWOT Analysis Framework Implementation

**1. Factor Prioritization:**
*   Using the synthesized data, prioritize each identified SWOT factor based on:
    *   **Strategic Significance:** How closely does it align with the organization's core business objectives?
    *   **Magnitude of Impact:** What is the potential positive or negative impact on business performance?
    *   **Likelihood:** How likely is this factor to occur or persist?
    *   **Urgency:** How quickly is a response required?

**2. Factor Interconnection Analysis:**
*   Map the relationships between internal and external factors to generate strategic options:
    *   **S-O Strategies (Leverage):** How can strengths be used to capitalize on opportunities?
    *   **S-T Strategies (Defend):** How can strengths be used to mitigate threats?
    *   **W-O Strategies (Build):** How can opportunities be leveraged to address internal weaknesses?
    *   **W-T Strategies (Survive):** How can the organization minimize the impact of threats and weaknesses?

**3. Strategic Implications Assessment:**
*   For each high-priority factor, analyze:
    *   The adequacy of the organization's current response.
    *   The resources required for strategic action.
    *   Potential competitive implications or reactions.
    *   Risk mitigation or opportunity capture strategies.
